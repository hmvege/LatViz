# LatViz

A program containing two methods for visualizing Gluonic fields, one with [Visit](https://wci.llnl.gov/simulation/computer-codes/visit) and one with [Mayavi](http://docs.enthought.com/mayavi/mayavi/).

The Visit branch is for using Visit.

*Note: Visit is only currently up and running for my local computer. Making it work in general will be quite difficult, and is not planned.*
